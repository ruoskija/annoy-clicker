# annoy-clicker
A shell script meant to annnoy my friend by slowly and repeatedly clicking a button on his website.

# Usage
Prepare by having the website with the button in question open in your browser. Run the script. You have ten seconds to move your cursor on to the button. Wait for it to finish clicking or CTRL^C in Bash to stop.

# Argument
The scipt takes one optional argumment: an integer representing the desired amount of clicks. E.g. bash poke.sh 10 for ten clicks. The default value is 100 clicks.
